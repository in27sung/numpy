[Numpy documentation v2.2](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html)

### What is NumPy?
- NumPt is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

### Why is NumPy Faster? 
> vectorization describes the absence of any explicit looping, indexing, etx., in the code - these
> things are taking place, of course, jut 'behind the scenes' in optimised, pre-compiled C code.
> Vectorized code has many advantes.

- Faster to read fewer bytes of memory
- No type-checking when iterating through objects
- Contiguous Memory

### How are Lists different from Numpy?

- Lists: Insertion, deletion, appending, concatenation
- NumPy: Insertion, deletion, appending, concatenation, etc.

### Load in NumPy (remember to pip install numpy first)
